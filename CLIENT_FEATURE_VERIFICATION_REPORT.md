| Contact Method Select | `<select>` | `rgb(255, 255, 255)` | PASS |
| Contact Value Input | `<input>` | `rgb(255, 255, 255)` | PASS |

**Total Fields Tested:** 7
**Fields with White Background:** 7
**Pass Rate:** 100%

#### Visual Verification

## Browser Console Verification

### Test Results

**STATUS: CLEAN**

- No console errors detected
- No JavaScript runtime errors
- No network errors
- Application logs are clean

---

## Additional Observations

### Positive Findings
1. **URL Normalization:** The API automatically redirects `/api/clients` to `/api/clients/` (with trailing slash), which is good practice
2. **Empty State Handling:** When no clients exist, the application shows a friendly empty state message
3. **Form Accessibility:** All form fields are properly labeled and accessible
4. **Responsive Design:** Search input and form fields maintain consistent styling
5. **Modal Interaction:** Client creation modal opens smoothly and displays correctly

### Technical Details
- **Authentication:** Login with admin@momentocake.com.br works correctly
- **Navigation:** Direct navigation to `/clients` works without redirects to login
- **API Response Time:** API calls complete in under 1 second
- **Page Load Time:** Page loads completely in under 3 seconds

---

## Test Methodology

### Test Execution
1. Automated login with admin credentials
2. Navigation to `/clients` page with network monitoring
3. API call interception and status code verification
4. Visual inspection of page load
5. Modal opening and form field inspection
6. Background color extraction using `window.getComputedStyle()`
7. Screenshot capture for evidence

### Technology Stack
- **Test Framework:** Playwright v1.x
- **Browser:** Chromium (latest)
- **Test Type:** End-to-end (E2E)
- **Assertions:** Strict equality checks for colors and HTTP status codes

## Conclusion

### Overall Assessment

**BOTH FIXES ARE WORKING CORRECTLY**

1. **Issue #1 - HTTP 500 Error Fix:**
   - The `/api/clients` endpoint no longer returns HTTP 500 errors
   - The page loads successfully with proper content
   - Users can access the Clientes page without errors

2. **Issue #2 - Form Field Background Colors:**
   - All form input fields have white backgrounds as intended
   - The search/filter input has a white background
   - The textarea and select elements have white backgrounds
   - Visual consistency has been achieved across all input fields

### Recommendations

1. **Production Deployment:** Both fixes are ready for production deployment
2. **Monitoring:** Monitor the `/api/clients` endpoint in production for any edge cases
3. **Cross-browser Testing:** Consider testing on Firefox and Safari for complete coverage
4. **Regression Testing:** Add these tests to the automated test suite to prevent regressions

### Sign-off

All requested verifications have been completed successfully. The Client management feature is functioning correctly with:
- No HTTP 500 errors
- Proper white backgrounds on all form fields
- Clean browser console
- Smooth user experience

**Test Status:** APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION
