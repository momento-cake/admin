## Summary

The implementation of the 80% test coverage plan is well underway with a solid foundation in place. Phases 1-4 are complete with 206 tests passing, establishing best practices for testing. The remaining phases (5-8) will focus on component testing, API route testing, integration testing, and validation/documentation.

The infrastructure is production-ready and can support rapid test creation in the remaining phases.

**Next Milestone**: Complete Phase 5 (Component Tests) - Target: 300+ total tests
**Final Milestone**: Achieve 80%+ coverage - Target: 425+ tests
