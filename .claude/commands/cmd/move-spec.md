# Move Spec

Move a spec folder between workflow folders (backlog/todo/done), update index.json, and optionally update status field.

## Variables

- $specIdOrNameOrPath: $1 (required) - Either a timestamp ID (e.g., `2510241201`), feature name (e.g., `workflow-safety`), or full path (e.g., `.agent/specs/todo/2510241201-workflow-safety/`)
- $targetFolder: $2 (required) - Target workflow folder: "backlog", "todo", or "done"

## Instructions

- Search for the spec folder in all locations (backlog/, todo/, done/)
- Move the entire folder to the target folder
- Update index.json with new location
- Update the Status field in spec.md front matter based on target folder
- Support both old single-file specs and new folder-based specs
- Report the old and new paths

## Workflow

1. **Find the Spec Folder or File**
   - **Parse and resolve $specIdOrNameOrPath:**
     - If it's a full path (contains `/`):
       - Use the path as-is
     - Otherwise, look up in `.agent/specs/index.json`:
       - For timestamp ID: Match by `id` field
       - For feature name: Fuzzy match path (e.g., `message-queue` matches `todo/2510241201-message-queue-implementation/spec.md`)
       - Use path from index: `.agent/specs/{path}` (extract folder from file path: `dirname({path})`)
     - **If not found in index.json, fallback to directory search:**
       - Search in order: `.agent/specs/backlog/`, `.agent/specs/todo/`, `.agent/specs/done/`
       - For ID: Pattern `{id}-*/`
       - For feature name: Pattern `*{feature-name}*/` (fuzzy match)
   - If still not found, report error and exit

2. **Validate Target Folder**
   - Ensure $targetFolder is one of: "backlog", "todo", or "done"
   - If invalid, report error and exit

3. **Check for Conflicts**
   - Check if a folder/file with the same name already exists in target folder
   - If conflict exists, report error and exit

4. **Move the Folder**
   - Move entire folder from current location to `.agent/specs/${targetFolder}/[foldername]`
   - Preserve the original folder name

5. **Update Index**
   - Read index.json
   - Update the spec's `path` field to match new location (e.g., `todo/folder/spec.md` → `done/folder/spec.md`)
   - Preserve the filename, only update the folder portion of the path
   - Update the spec's `updated` field to current timestamp
   - Update the spec's `status` field based on target folder (see step 6)
   - Write updated index back to `.agent/specs/index.json`

6. **Update Status Field**
   - Read spec.md file content
   - Update Status field in spec.md based on target folder:
     - Moving to "backlog": Set to "backlog"
     - Moving to "todo": Keep current status (typically "draft" or "in-progress")
     - Moving to "done": Set to "completed"
   - Also update status in index.json (step 5)

   **Status Lifecycle**: `draft` → `in-progress` → `review` → `completed`

7. **Report Results**
   - Display old path
   - Display new path
   - Display status field update (if any)
   - Display index update (path and updated timestamp)

## Examples

**Example 1: Move by timestamp spec ID**

```bash
/cmd:move-spec 2510241201 done
```

Finds `2510241201-*/` folder and moves it to `done/`, updates index

**Example 2: Move back to todo**

```bash
/cmd:move-spec 2511131522 todo
```

Finds `2511131522-*/` folder and moves it to `todo/`

**Example 3: Move by feature name**

```bash
/cmd:move-spec workflow-safety done
```

Finds `*-workflow-safety/` folder and moves it to `done/`

## Report

**IMPORTANT**: Output ONLY raw JSON (see `.agent/docs/slash-command-json-output-format.md`).
