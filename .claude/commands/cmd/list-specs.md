# List Specs

List all specs in the `.agent/specs/` directory, organized by workflow folder and optionally filtered by status field. Uses index.json for fast lookups of timestamp ID specs.

## Variables

- $folder: $1 (optional) - Filter by folder: "backlog", "todo", "done", or "all" (defaults to "all")
- $status: $2 (optional) - Filter by status field: "draft", "ready", "in-progress", "review", "completed", or "any" (defaults to "any")
- --search: (optional) - Search keyword to fuzzy match in spec names/paths
- --sort: (optional) - Sort field: "created", "updated", "id", "complexity", "phases", or "tasks" (defaults to "created")

## Instructions

- Read index.json for fast lookup of timestamp ID specs
- Parse spec files to extract metadata (Status field) only when status filtering is needed
- Filter by folder if specified
- Filter by status if specified
- Search by keyword if specified (fuzzy match in spec names)
- Sort results by specified field
- Group specs in same folder for multi-spec folders
- Display results organized by folder with spec ID, feature name, created/updated dates, and status

## Workflow

1. **Load Specs from Index**

   - Read `.agent/specs/index.json`
   - For each spec in index, extract:
     - Spec ID (key in specs object)
     - Path (contains both location and folder name)
     - Status (cached from spec.md)
     - Created datetime
     - Updated datetime
     - Location: Derive from path by splitting on '/' (e.g., "todo/1-log-streaming" → location="todo", folder="1-log-streaming")

2. **Apply Filters**

   - **Folder filter**:
     - If $folder is "backlog": Only show specs where location (from path) is "backlog"
     - If $folder is "todo": Only show specs where location is "todo"
     - If $folder is "done": Only show specs where location is "done"
     - If $folder is "all" or not provided: Show all specs

   - **Status filter**:
     - If $status is specified and not "any":
       - Use cached status from index.json
       - Only include specs matching that status
     - If $status is "any" or not provided: Show all specs
     - If a spec has no status field in index, treat it as status "unknown"

   - **Search filter**:
     - If --search is specified:
       - Extract feature name from path (e.g., "todo/251112-workflow-item/spec.md" → "workflow-item")
       - Fuzzy match: Check if search keyword appears anywhere in feature name (case-insensitive)
       - Only include specs where feature name contains the search keyword

3. **Sort Results**

   - Sort specs by specified field (defaults to "created"):
     - "created": Sort by created timestamp (oldest first)
     - "updated": Sort by updated timestamp (newest first)
     - "id": Sort by spec ID (chronological order)
     - "complexity": Sort by totalComplexity (highest first, specs without complexity at end)
     - "phases": Sort by phaseCount (highest first, specs without phases at end)
     - "tasks": Sort by taskCount (highest first, specs without tasks at end)

4. **Group Multi-Spec Folders**

   - Extract folder path (without filename) from each spec path
   - Group specs that share the same folder path
   - Display folder header when multiple specs share a folder

5. **Display Results**

   - Group specs by location (backlog, todo, done)
   - Within each group, apply sort order from step 3
   - For each spec, display:
     - Spec ID
     - Feature name (from folder/file name)
     - Created date (from index)
     - Updated date (from index) if different from created
     - Status (from index)
     - Complexity (from index) if present: "X pts, N phases, N tasks" or "Not estimated"
   - For multi-spec folders (multiple specs in same folder):
     - Display folder header once
     - Indent individual spec entries
   - Show count for each location
   - Show total count

## Status Legend

Display at the bottom of output:

```text
Status Values:
  draft       - Initial draft, not ready for implementation
  ready       - Reviewed and ready to implement
  in-progress - Currently being implemented
  review      - Implementation complete, awaiting review
  completed   - Fully implemented and reviewed
  unknown     - No status field found in spec
```

## Empty Results

If no specs match the filters:

```text
No specs found matching filters:
- Folder: todo
- Status: completed

Try adjusting your filters or run /list-specs without arguments to see all specs.
```

## Error Handling

If `.agent/specs/` directory doesn't exist:

```text
✗ Error: .agent/specs/ directory not found

Please create the directory or check your working directory.
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Performance**: Read index.json for O(1) lookup - status is cached, no file reads needed
- **Feature names**: Extract from folder/file name in path
  - From path: `todo/251024120101-workflow-safety/spec.md` → location="todo", folder="251024120101-workflow-safety", name="workflow-safety"
  - For multi-spec: `todo/251112-auth/backend.md` → folder="251112-auth", name="backend"
- **Sorting**:
  - "created": Sort by created timestamp (oldest first)
  - "updated": Sort by updated timestamp (newest first for recently active specs)
  - "id": Sort by spec ID (chronological by creation)
- **Search**: Case-insensitive fuzzy matching on feature name extracted from path
- **Multi-spec grouping**: Group by folder path (dirname of spec path), show folder header when >1 spec in folder
- **Status caching**: Status is cached in index.json, synced from spec.md by other commands
- **Backward compatibility**: Positional args still work: `/list-specs todo completed`
