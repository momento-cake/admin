argument-hint: [specIdOrNameOrPath]

# Implement

Follow the `Workflow` steps in the exact order to implement the spec then `Report` the completed work.

## Variables

- $specIdOrNameOrPath: $1 (required) - Either a timestamp ID (e.g., `2510241201`), feature name (e.g., `workflow-safety`), or full path

## Instructions

**Parse and resolve $specIdOrNameOrPath:**

- If it's a full path (contains `/`): use as-is
- Otherwise, look up in `.agent/specs/index.json`:
  - For timestamp ID: Match by `id` field
  - For feature name: Fuzzy match path (e.g., `message-queue` matches `todo/2510241201-message-queue-implementation/spec.md`)
  - Use path from index: `.agent/specs/{path}`
- **If not found in index.json, fallback to directory search:**
  - Search in order: todo/, backlog
  - For ID: Pattern `{id}-*/spec.md`
  - For feature name: Pattern `*{feature-name}*/spec.md` (fuzzy match)
- If still not found: stop and report error

## Task Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL: You MUST track your progress in the spec file as you work. This is NOT optional.**

### What to Update

1. **Individual Tasks** - Check off IMMEDIATELY after completing each task:
   - Change `- [ ] 1.1 Task description` to `- [x] 1.1 Task description`
   - Do this AFTER finishing each task, NOT in batches
   - Never move to the next task without checking off the current one

2. **Completion Notes** - Fill in after finishing each task group/phase:
   - Each task group has a `#### Completion Notes` section
   - Write 2-4 bullet points with:
     - What was implemented
     - Any deviations from the plan
     - Important context for reviewers
     - Known issues or follow-ups

### Example of Good Progress Tracking

**Before starting task 1.1:**

```markdown
### 1: Project Initialization

- [ ] 1.1 Initialize Bun project
- [ ] 1.2 Configure package.json
```

**After completing task 1.1:**

```markdown
### 1: Project Initialization

- [x] 1.1 Initialize Bun project
- [ ] 1.2 Configure package.json
```

**After completing all tasks in group 1:**

```markdown
### 1: Project Initialization

- [x] 1.1 Initialize Bun project
- [x] 1.2 Configure package.json

#### Completion Notes

- Project initialized with Bun and TypeScript
- Used stricter tsconfig settings than spec suggested for better type safety
- All dependencies installed successfully
```

## Workflow

1. Parse and resolve the spec file path according to the instructions above
2. **Update spec Status:**
   - If spec is in `todo/` folder with Status "draft", update Status to "in-progress"
   - This indicates work has started without moving the file
3. **Update index.json:**
   - Update the spec's `status` field to "in-progress"
   - Update the spec's `updated` field to current timestamp
   - Write updated index back to `.agent/specs/index.json`
4. Read $spec_path file, think hard about the plan
5. Implement the plan, one phase at a time:
   - Work through tasks in order, top to bottom
   - **IMMEDIATELY check off each task** in $spec_path after completing it
   - Run validation after each logical step
6. After completing each task group/phase:
   - **Fill in the "Completion Notes" section** with implementation context
   - Include any deviations, decisions, or important notes for reviewers
7. Continue until all tasks are checked off and all completion notes are filled
8. **Update spec Status to "review":**
   - Update Status field in spec.md to "review"
   - Update index.json:
     - Set `status` field to "review"
     - Update `updated` field to current timestamp
   - Write updated index back to `.agent/specs/index.json`
   - This indicates implementation is complete and ready for review

## Validation Commands

Run validation checks from the spec's Validation section after each logical step:

**Critical Checks** (must pass):
- **Build**: `pnpm build` (or package-specific build command)
- **Type-check**: `pnpm check-types` (or `tsc --noEmit`)

**Important Checks** (should pass):
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint` (or package-specific lint command)
- **Tests**: `pnpm test` (or package-specific test command)

Run these after completing:
- Each phase (minimum)
- Complex tasks (recommended)
- Before marking spec as "review" (required)

## Error Handling

If a task fails during implementation:

1. **Document the failure**:
   - Add failure note in Completion Notes
   - Mark failed task: `- [ ] ~~1.1 Task description~~ ❌ FAILED: [reason]`

2. **Assess impact**:
   - Can you continue with other tasks?
   - Is this a blocker for subsequent tasks?

3. **Update status**:
   - Set `implementation_status: "partial"` in JSON output
   - Keep spec status as `"in-progress"`
   - Populate `error` field with details

4. **Report to user**:
   - Include failure details in JSON output
   - Ask for guidance if blocked

## Success/Failure Criteria

**Success (`success: true`)**:

- All tasks completed (`tasks.completed === tasks.total`)
- All critical validation checks passed (build, type-check)
- No critical errors during implementation
- Spec file updated to `status: "review"`
- `implementation_status: "completed"`

**Failure (`success: false`)**:

- Any task not completed (`tasks.completed < tasks.total`)
- Critical validation failed (build or type-check errors)
- Process interrupted or error thrown
- Spec file remains in `status: "in-progress"`
- `implementation_status: "partial"` or `"failed"`

**Partial Completion**: When some tasks complete but others fail, set `success: false` with `implementation_status: "partial"` and populate `error` field.

## Report

**IMPORTANT**: Output ONLY raw JSON (see `.agent/docs/slash-command-json-output-format.md`).
