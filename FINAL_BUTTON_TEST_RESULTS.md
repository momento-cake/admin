## What Was Fixed

The z-index fix applied in commit `035e506` successfully resolved the button click detection issue:

### Changes Made:
1. **RelatedPersonsSection.tsx**: Added `z-0` to section container and `z-10` to button
2. **SpecialDatesSection.tsx**: Added `z-0` to section container and `z-10` to button

### How It Works:
- The z-index positioning ensures buttons are on top of form elements
- Prevents invisible overlays from blocking click events
- Maintains proper visual hierarchy in the modal
