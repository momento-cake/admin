# Special Dates Page - 500 Error Investigation Report

## Summary
The `/clients/special-dates` page is throwing a **500 Internal Server Error** due to a missing Turbopack runtime module during the server-side rendering process.

---

## Error Details

### Primary Error Message
```
Runtime Error

Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'
```

### Error Location
- **File**: `/.next/server/pages/_document.js` (line 1)
- **HTTP Status**: 500
- **Redirect URL**: `/login/?redirect=%2Fclients%2Fspecial-dates%2F`

### Full Error Stack
```
Error: Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'
Require stack:
- /Users/gabrielaraujo/projects/momentocake/admin/.next/server/pages/_document.js
- /Users/gabrielaraujo/projects/momentocake/admin/node_modules/next/dist/server/require.js
- /Users/gabrielaraujo/projects/momentocake/admin/node_modules/next/dist/server/load-components.js
[... full stack trace available in test output]
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `_document.js` file generated by Next.js/Turbopack is trying to require a runtime module that doesn't exist:

**Generated _document.js (line 1):**
```javascript
var R=require("../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js")("server/pages/_document.js")
```

**Issue**: The file `[turbopack]_runtime.js` does not exist in the `.next/server/chunks/ssr/` directory.

### Verification
```bash
# Search for Turbopack runtime file
$ find .next/server -name "*turbopack*runtime*"
# Result: No files found
```

### Why This Happens
This error typically occurs when:

1. **Incomplete Next.js Build**: The build process didn't complete successfully or was interrupted
2. **Turbopack Development Mode Issue**: Using Turbopack in development with incomplete module resolution
3. **Build Cache Corruption**: The `.next` directory has stale or corrupted build artifacts
4. **Next.js Version Compatibility**: Possible version mismatch or Turbopack instability

## Evidence Captured

### Screenshots
1. **Error Page Screenshot**: `test-results/special-dates-direct.png`
   - Shows Next.js error page with full stack trace
   - Runtime Error header clearly visible
   - Call stack shows 45 frames

2. **First Capture**: `test-results/.../test-failed-1.png`
   - Same error from initial test run

### Browser Console
```
[error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
[log] [HMR] connected
```

### Page Response Data
```json
{
  "props": {
    "pageProps": {
      "statusCode": 500,
      "hostname": "localhost"
    }
  },
  "page": "/_error",
  "query": {
    "redirect": "/clients/special-dates/"
  },
  "buildId": "development"
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### Affected Routes
- **Primary**: `/clients/special-dates` - Cannot be accessed
- **Potential**: Any route that triggers server-side rendering with the current build

### User Experience
- Users trying to access special dates functionality receive a 500 error
- Error page shows technical details (not production-friendly)
- Authentication redirect occurs but page never loads

### System Status
- **Development Server**: Running on port 4000 (confirmed)
- **Other Routes**: Need verification if affected
- **Authentication**: Working (redirects function correctly)

---

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Clean Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop the development server
# Kill process on port 4000

# Clean Next.js build artifacts
rm -rf .next

# Clean node modules cache (if needed)
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Restart development server
npm run dev
```

### Solution 2: Disable Turbopack (Fallback)
If Turbopack is causing issues, use standard webpack:

**Option A - Command line:**
```bash
# Run dev without Turbopack
next dev
```

**Option B - Package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 4000"
  }
}
```

### Solution 3: Check Next.js Configuration
Verify `next.config.js` for any Turbopack-specific configuration that might be causing issues.

## Testing Verification

### Test File Created
- **File**: `tests/direct-special-dates-check.spec.ts`
- **Purpose**: Captures error details, console logs, and screenshots
- **Status**: Successfully executed and captured error

### Test Results
```
✓ 1 [chromium] › tests/direct-special-dates-check.spec.ts:4:7
  Direct Special Dates Investigation › Navigate directly to special-dates
  and capture error (2.6s)

1 passed (4.3s)
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Clean the `.next` directory and restart the dev server
2. **Verify Fix**: Navigate to `/clients/special-dates` after rebuild
3. **Test Other Routes**: Check if other pages are affected
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any similar Turbopack-related errors
5. **Consider Production Build**: Test if issue persists in production build

## Additional Information

### Environment
- **Next.js Version**: 15.5.2 (using Turbopack)
- **Node Version**: v23.1.0
- **Development Port**: 4000
- **Test Date**: 2025-10-29

## Contact & Support

If cleaning the build doesn't resolve the issue, consider:
1. Checking Next.js GitHub issues for similar Turbopack problems
2. Verifying Next.js 15.5.2 compatibility with current project setup
3. Testing with Turbopack disabled as a temporary workaround
4. Checking if custom `_document.tsx` or `_app.tsx` files are causing conflicts
