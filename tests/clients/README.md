## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Application running on `http://localhost:3001`
- Database accessible
- Valid login credentials in `.env.local`

### Run All Tests
```bash
npx playwright test tests/clients/
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
npx playwright test tests/clients/client-management.spec.ts -g "should create a personal client"
```

### Run Tests in Headed Mode
```bash
npx playwright test tests/clients/ --headed
```

### Run Tests with UI
```bash
npx playwright test tests/clients/ --ui
```

### View Test Report
```bash
npx playwright show-report test-results/clients
```

## Test Data

Tests use dynamic data with timestamps to ensure uniqueness:
- Client names: `Cliente Teste {timestamp}`
- Company names: `Empresa Teste {timestamp}`
- Email: Dynamic based on test type

## Login Credentials

Tests use admin credentials for authentication:
- Email: `admin@momentocake.com.br`
- Password: `G8j5k188`

## Troubleshooting

### Test Timeouts
- Ensure application is running on port 3001
- Check network connectivity
- Increase timeout in config if needed

### Element Not Found
- Verify selectors match current UI
- Update selectors if component structure changed
- Check if elements are visible/enabled

### Login Fails
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check Firebase configuration
- Ensure database is accessible

## Screenshots

Test results include screenshots for:
- Initial page state
- Form filled with data
- Success states
- Error states
- Pagination controls

Screenshots are saved to `test-results/clients/`

## CI/CD Integration

For GitHub Actions or similar:

```yaml
- name: Run Client Management Tests
  run: npx playwright test tests/clients/ --reporter=html

- name: Upload Test Results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: test-results/clients/
```

## Maintenance

### Updating Tests
1. Update selectors if UI changes
2. Add new tests for new features
3. Update test data as needed
4. Run full suite before committing

### Known Issues
- Tests may timeout if network is slow
- Business client form uses nested inputs (multiple elements with same name)
- Delete confirmation dialog timing varies
