- Firestore CRUD operations (`src/lib/clients.ts`)

### Phase 2: API Routes ✅
- REST API endpoints with proper error handling
- Pagination and search support
- Soft delete and restore functionality

### Phase 3: Components - Forms ✅
- New client form with dynamic sections
- Personal and business client variants
- Contact methods management
- Address fields
- Notes and preferences

### Phase 4: List & Detail Views ✅
- Client list with grid layout
- Search functionality
- Type filtering
- Pagination controls
- Detail view with all client information
- Edit form with pre-populated data

### Phase 5: E2E Testing ✅
- Comprehensive Playwright test suite
- 10+ test scenarios

## Component Architecture

### Pages
- **`/clients`** - List view with search and filters
- **`/clients/new`** - Create new client form
- **`/clients/[id]`** - Client detail view
- **`/clients/[id]/edit`** - Edit client form

### API Endpoints
```
GET    /api/clients                         # List clients with filters
POST   /api/clients                         # Create client
GET    /api/clients/[id]                    # Get client details
PUT    /api/clients/[id]                    # Update client
DELETE /api/clients/[id]                    # Soft delete client
POST   /api/clients/[id]/restore            # Restore deleted client
```

## Database Design

### Firestore Collection: `clients`
- Document ID: Auto-generated
- Type discriminator: `type` ('person' or 'business')
- Embedded arrays for:
  - Contact methods
  - Related persons (optional)
  - Special dates (optional)

### Key Fields
- Core: id, type, name, email, cpfCnpj, phone
- Contact: contactMethods[] (with type, value, isPrimary)
- Address: cep, estado, cidade, bairro, endereco, numero, complemento
- Business: companyInfo, representative
- Metadata: isActive, createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, lastModifiedBy

## Validation Rules

### Personal Clients
- Name: 2-100 characters, required
- Email: Valid email format (optional)
- CPF: Valid CPF format (optional)
- Contact methods: Minimum 1 required

### Business Clients
- Company name: 2-150 characters, required
- CNPJ: Valid CNPJ format, required, unique
- Representative name, email, phone: All required
- Contact methods: Minimum 1 required

## Navigation Integration

### Sidebar Menu
Added "Clientes" section in main sidebar with submenu:
- **Listagem** - Navigate to `/clients`
- **Novo Cliente** - Navigate to `/clients/new`

Access level: Admin and Viewer roles

## Testing

### E2E Test Suite
Located in `tests/clients/client-management.spec.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
1. Display clients page
2. Create personal client
3. Create business client
4. Search clients
5. Filter by client type
6. View client details
7. Edit client information
8. Delete client
9. Validation error handling
10. Pagination

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# All tests
npx playwright test tests/clients/

# Specific test
npx playwright test tests/clients/client-management.spec.ts -g "create personal"

# Headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test tests/clients/ --headed

# With UI
npx playwright test tests/clients/ --ui

# View report
npx playwright show-report test-results/clients
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: Clients loaded in batches (default 20)
2. **Search**: Client-side filtering for small datasets
3. **Lazy Loading**: Related data loaded on demand
4. **Indexing**: Firestore indexes for common queries
5. **Caching**: Consider implementing for frequently accessed clients

## Security

- ✅ Input validation (client and server-side)
- ✅ Unique constraint enforcement
- ✅ Soft delete for data preservation
- ✅ Timestamp tracking (created, updated)
- ✅ User tracking (createdBy, lastModifiedBy)
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement user authorization checks in API

## Known Limitations

1. **Related Persons**: Type defined but UI not fully implemented
2. **Special Dates**: Type defined but UI not fully implemented
3. **Contact Methods**: Limited to embedded array (no subcollection)
4. **Authorization**: API doesn't yet validate user permissions
5. **Bulk Operations**: No bulk import/export functionality

## Future Enhancements (Phase 6+)

1. **Related Persons Management**
   - UI for adding/editing related persons
   - Family/relationship tracking
   - Birthday reminders for related persons

2. **Special Dates Management**
   - Calendar integration
   - Automated birthday notifications
   - Marketing campaign triggers

3. **Sales Platform Integration**
   - Read-only API endpoints for sales platform
   - Special dates query for marketing
   - Client segmentation

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Bulk import from CSV
   - Export to PDF/Excel
   - Client communication history
   - Interaction timeline
   - Custom tags and categorization
   - Role-based field visibility

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching strategy
   - Optimize Firestore queries
   - Add full-text search indexing
   - Implement infinite scroll
